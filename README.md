# 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline in Docker

A **code-first deep learning project** implemented with pandas and containerized using Docker for seamless execution without any local environment setup.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model implementation that runs entirely within Docker containers. The goal is to perform all training and inference operations without installing any special tools locally - just write your code and run it!

### ✨ Key Features
- 🐳 **Docker-first approach** - No local Python/ML dependencies needed
- 📊 **Pandas-based data processing** - Familiar DataFrame workflows
- 🚀 **One-command execution** - Everything runs with `docker compose up`
- 💾 **Automatic output organization** - Results saved in structured folders
- 🔄 **Reproducible environments** - Consistent runs every time


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```
2. **Run the entire pipeline:**
```bash
