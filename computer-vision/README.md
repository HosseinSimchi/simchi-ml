## 🧠 Computer Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository!

This repository contains a collection of diverse and practical computer vision implementations, ranging from classical image processing to deep learning–based models. Each project is designed to be educational, modular, and easy to understand, whether you're a beginner exploring vision concepts or an advanced user looking for ready-to-use components.

#### 📌 Repository Overview

This repository includes:

✔️ Image classification (deep learning models: CNNs, transfer learning, fine-tuning)

✔️ Object detection (YOLO, SSD, OpenCV-based techniques)

✔️ Image segmentation (semantic + instance segmentation, U-Net models)

✔️ Feature extraction & matching (SIFT, ORB, feature descriptors)

✔️ Traditional image processing (filters, edge detection, morphology)

✔️ Computer vision utilities (preprocessing pipelines, augmentation, visualization tools)

Each project lives in its own directory with clear structure:

project-name/

│── README.md        # Detailed explanation of the project  
│── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for experiments  
│── src/             # Main source code  
│── models/          # Trained models (if provided)  
│── samples/         # Example images or demo results  
│── requirements.txt

#### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created to:

Demonstrate end-to-end computer vision workflows

Provide clean and reusable implementations

Serve as a learning resource for students, researchers, and developers

Show real-world applications of modern CV techniques

Document personal hands-on experience in vision-based AI development

Whether you're studying for interviews, doing research, or building your own model, these projects can serve as a reference.
